# We Grow Grand Rapids

Welcome to Citizen Labs, a place for innovation and citizen engagement focused on improving our community.

- We work together with our community to use open data and open source technology to promote transparency, better understand problems, make better choices, and provide solutions that work.

- We are developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help local and state governments, and civic organizations.

## We provide Grand Rapids with:

**Inspiration, Mentoring, and Access to Resources:** We are online - all the time - working on projects that are important to our community. We also meet twice every month for a "hack night," open events where individuals and groups of individuals can work, share, and learn in an inclusive environment

**Infrastructure and Physical Resources:** We provide technical infrastructure and physical resources for the over 20 projects that are in our pipeline.

**Connection and Awareness:** We are active in many different communities that form the tapestry of Grand Rapids. Our relationships reach from the private sector, local government, other nonprofits, and into neighborhood associations.

**Talent:** We are broad group of over 80 active citizens who support growing Grand Rapids into the best it can be.
